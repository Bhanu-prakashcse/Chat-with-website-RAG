💬 Chat with Website using RAG Pipeline

> 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered intelligent web content querying

---

🧠 Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** that allows users to interact with the content of a website via natural language queries. Leveraging modern **LLMs (like GPT-4)**, this system can intelligently respond to questions based on both **structured and unstructured data** extracted from any website.

The solution supports automated web scraping, vector-based embedding storage, and semantic similarity search to retrieve the most relevant content before generating a human-like response.

🔧 Features

- 🕸️ **Web Crawling & Scraping** – Collect structured and unstructured content from target websites.
- 🧩 **Vector Embedding Storage** – Store processed content in a vector DB for fast similarity search.
- 🔍 **Semantic Retrieval** – Match user queries with relevant content using cosine similarity or FAISS.
- 🧠 **GPT-4 Answer Generation** – Generate rich, context-aware responses from the retrieved content.
- 💬 **Interactive Chat Interface** – Simple and responsive frontend to simulate conversation with the website.

🧪 How it Works

-**Crawling**: Crawl the target website using scraping tools.

-**Embedding**: Generate vector embeddings for scraped content.

-**Storage**: Store the vectors in a DB (like FAISS or Chroma).

-**Querying**: Accept user questions through chat UI.
